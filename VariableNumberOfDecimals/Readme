Thank you for downloading this project.

Did you ever have a problem when you should display a double with variable number of decimals?
For example: a user wants to see only X decimals in a number(defined by user in the settings).
Instead of doing all that useless work you can just use VariableNumberOfDecimals!



How does it work?

Simple import it in your project and then just call a method:

[VariableNumberOfDecimals getFormatForNumber:<#(double)#> withNumberOfDecimals:<#(int)#>];

Result will be an NSString that is a format to use to present a number.

After that you can simple log it or put in a UILabel/UITextField/whatever:
NSLog(format, yourDoubleNumber);

Where format is the result of the method and yourDoubleNumber is your double number.

Hope you will like it.
